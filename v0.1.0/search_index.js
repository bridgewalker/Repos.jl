That was a nice new insight but to verify the maths we needed to run agent-based simulations.","category":"page"},{"location":"project.html","page":"About the package","title":"About the package","text":"In small simulations the predicted oscillations did not happen. The reason was that even in a simulation with some thousand agents random events randomness at the agent level can still have a significant impact. This created a lot of noise that destroyed the oscillations.","category":"page"},{"location":"project.html","page":"About the package","title":"About the package","text":"We needed bigger simulations. Agent based simulations on a network suffer from bad data locality and hence don't parallelize well. So they remain challenging.","category":"page"},{"location":"project.html","page":"About the package","title":"About the package","text":"In principle agent-based simulation can be done extremely quickly using a technique called event-driven (Gillespie) simulation. In an event driven simulation there is certain functions that are called many times: finding out how many agents are in a given state (i.e. infected), picking a random agent who has a certain state and changing the state an agent is in.","category":"page"},{"location":"project.html","page":"About the package","title":"About the package","text":"To speed up my simulations I came up with the Repo data structure.
